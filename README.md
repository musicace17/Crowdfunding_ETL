# Crowdfunding_ETL


### For the ETL mini project, we (Omar Khan and Carter Jackson) worked together to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data provided. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database and exported a sql file of the query needed to verify the imports happened succesfully.
